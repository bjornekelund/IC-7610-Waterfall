# IC-7610 waterfall control and zoom
WPF application for automatic per-band/per-mode waterfall setting and convenient pile-up zoom. 

Somewhat obsolete for DXLab users but could be useful for others.
Typically connects to the second, physical CI-V port of the IC-7610 with the logger connected to the main, USB, CI-V port.
Sets waterfall/spectrum display range and reference level based on either mode/band or for a pile-up situation.

Since mid 2018 all of this functionality is included in DXLab Commander.
